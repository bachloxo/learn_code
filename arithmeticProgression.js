// Given the first two elements of an arithmetic progression, find its nth element.

// Example

// For element1 = 3, element2 = 2, and n = 4, the output should be
// arithmeticProgression(element1, element2, n) = 0.
// The difference between two consecutive elements of the arithmetic progression is element2 - element1 = -1. Thus, the third element of the progression is 1, and the fourth one is 0, which is the answer.
function arithmeticProgression(a, b, n) {
  return a + (b - a) * --n;
}

console.log(arithmeticProgression(2, 2, 10000));
